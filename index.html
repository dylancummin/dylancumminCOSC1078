<h2> An interesting fact </h2>

<p>  
I’d consider myself an athletic person, I’ve played many sports ranging from aussie rules to swimming, golf and cricket. I’ve played football for over 10 years winning 2 out of 3 premierships and captaining for one season and while playing cricket achieved 2 premierships as well. An interesting fact about myself is the obscure amount of injuries I’ve experienced. These injuries vary from pulling my hamstring or sore achilles to fracturing my patella and tibia (on different occasions). This resulted in my overall reputation as always someone that's always injuring myself, I managed to sadly keep that reputation as I fractured my foot while running on a beach in Gold Coast. So I’d say that I’m very experienced with crutches and moon boots.
