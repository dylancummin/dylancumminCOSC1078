<h1> Personal Profile </h1>
<p>
After the completion of the Myer-Briggs test, Online Learning style test and a Career Personality test it highlights my strengths and weaknesses as a person. The results of the Myer-Briggs test allow me to develop an understanding of how I react to different environments and situations that involve decision making. This test shows how I can be outgoing with others while showing confidence in my own skills and abilities. The learning style test resulted in my learning style being a visual learner. This means that I tend to understand concepts more through witnessing it rather than be told how to do it.  The final test that I decided to choose was one that ultimately tries to choose the correct career for you to pursue. Information Technology was one of the industries that was recommended which is reassuring in helping me believe I’ve chosen the correct life path. All of these tests give an insight to the individual and their own attributes and what they can offer to the work environment and show their potential within the work industry.
