<h1> Interest in IT </h1>
<h3> What is your interest in IT?</h3>
<p>
Information Technology caught my interest through the hardware aspect of it, the curiosity of how a computer functions and the parts required to build one. I took a VET course during high school labeled “Information, Digital Media and Technology’. This course exposed me to programming, hardware and IT in the workplace which further developed my interest in the IT industry. </p>

<h3> When did your interest in IT start?</h3>
<p> My interest in information technology originated from my early years when my dad built his own computer. The PC consisted of an i5 760, 8gb RAM and a Radeon hd 7850, primarily being used to run games such as F1 2010, Fifa and SimCity etc. I didn’t begin to take more interest into pc gaming and IT until during high school when my mates started to build their own computers to play multiplayer games. Originally, I started using my Lenovo Yoga 3 to play CSGO or Terraria but soon realised our family computer was somewhat capable of ‘gaming’. Due to the hardware being outdated and beginning to show signs of failure I experienced many cases of BSOD, this required me to spend hours of my time reading through threads and manuals to better my chances of troubleshooting the issue. Soon I began progressively upgrading the computer, replacing the cooler, GPU then eventually the entire PC (over a long period of time).

<h3> Why did you choose RMIT? </h3>
<p>
RMIT is a widely respected university within Melbourne for a long period of time, every time I venture into the city, I’d find myself walking past the vast facilities of RMIT. When it came to choosing my preferences during the end of high school RMIT was already high on my list due to the large amount of positive feedback from current and previous students. After further investigation into the university I uncovered its wide range of support systems which support students during the beginning of their new chapter. This was very appealing to me as the transition from highschool to university was expected to be different. The location of RMIT was very fitting as it was so close to the train station. Overall, the main goal is gaining the knowledge and experience needed to succeed within the IT industry and RMIT seemed like the right place to begin that journey.

<h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
<p>
During my studies at RMIT I hope to further develop a more in depth understanding on the different aspects involved within information technology and how it interacts within society. During my time at RMIT I expect to improve my skills in programming such as HTML, CSS and Python. I’m expecting to improve my ability to work alongside peers to troubleshoot and brainstorm unique ways to complete given tasks.
