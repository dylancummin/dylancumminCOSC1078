<h1> Project Idea - Elderly Assist </h1>
<h3> Overview </h3>
<p>My project idea consists of an app that can assist elderly people on how to use technology. The app can include tutorials on how to accomplish specific tasks such as updating windows or converting a word document into a PDF. This app can also include an overlay system that can be enabled for third party apps such as Facebook or Google that can explain how to use the application. There is also an option to make it even more simple for the elderly by redesigning the interface for the app to make it easier to use. An example of this would be redesigning the layout of Google to make it as simple as possible to understand. </p>

<h3> Motivation </h3>
<p> When it comes to technology the elderly is the generation that struggles with the concept of application and technology in general. This is the result of not being taught by others on how to properly use their devices, even the process of searching up on the web or watching Youtube videos can be too difficult for some. This application will assist elderly enormously as they struggle to completely grasp how to use modern apps and develop an idea on the basic functions on their device. The app will be useful not only for the elderly but for the children and grandchildren that will not be required to help their family members on how to use Facebook or Google etc. In a survey with over 750 older Australians conducted by RMIT it was observed that the elderly had high levels of digital ownership but only “moderate” levels of confidence in using their devices. In modern times when technology is all around us it is unfair to leave a generation left in the dark when there are so many possibilities available for them to utilise. </p>

<h3> Description </h3>
<p> This application will ultimately have three main features, one includes having an overlay system that can be used with apps that are supported to have pop ups and overlays on how the app functions and what each button can do. The second feature is completely redesigning the app and making it extremely simple for the user to use. The third feature is an area that is purely for searching tutorials on how to do certain tasks, these videos will run through how to do the given task with as much detail as possible. These tasks could include how to save documents or connect your laptop to the internet. The first feature will activate when the supported app is opened for the first time, it will begin to run through a step by step process of explaining each important button with minimal effort. These kinds of overlays can be seen on Google applications such as google docs when a new feature is added. This resolves the issue of individuals not understanding how to use specific apps as they will be taught from the beginning. The second feature is including a library of supported apps such as Youtube, Google or Facebook within the application, the apps within this library will be redesigned in such a way that minimises the confusion for the individual. This could include minimising the amount of buttons displayed or even enlarging the buttons that are commonly used just so the user does not miss it. This would greatly improve the experience with the app as it would be easier for the user to navigate around the application. The third feature includes a section that allows users to search up how to complete a certain task. The app then uses Google to search up and display the most useful video for the required task, it will also only show the relevant section in the video so that it is very precise and straight to the point. The application will also have the option to have a social media like platform where they are able to post their unique issues online where thousands of other users or experts can directly offer solutions to the problem. And to ensure the user isn't overwhelmed with answers that may be useless or confusing, each response will be reviewed by an expert. Alongside this users will have the ability to friend other users such as friends or family so they can directly communicate to them via the application. A help function will also be available which allows the user to directly communicate with an employee if any faults with the application arises. </p>

<h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
<p>MIT app inventor is software that will be utilised to help create the app. MIT app inventor is a helpful tool as it has the ability to design the app and develop the functions that will assist the app in being as efficient as possible. Java is the language that will be used to help assist in developing the application. Laptops and computers will be used to input the relevant code and information to help develop and design the application. Smartphones will be used to test the outcome of the application, these smartphones would include IOS and Android based devices.</p>

<h3> Skills Required </h3>
<p>The skills required to make this project a reality involve programming. Java will need to be used to program the app, which is one of the most common and highly respected language used. MIT app inventor while also being used to help develop the app. This project would require high levels of communication between the members within the group to ensure the application comes together smoothly. Other skills include user interface and experience. This is to ensure the layout of the app is extremely efficient, minimalist and simple to understand. Design is another skill that is required to make the application as presentable as possible. These skills come together to make the application attractive and efficient. </p>

<h3> Outcome </h3>
<p> If the app is successful then the outcome will be elderly that can use their devices with confidence and without confusion. This app will decrease the amount of older Australians that struggle to fully understand the capabilities of their smartphones. The original problem was the elderly struggling to efficiently use their devices but if the app does its intended purpose then this issue will be resolved, this is going to be achieved by developing creative and efficient ways of teaching the elderly on how to use their devices. If the app is successful it will create more motivation and momentum in continually improving the applications ability to educate the elderly on modern technology. </p>
