<h1>Ideal Job - Head of IT at Monde Nissin Australia</h1>
<h3> What is the role and why is it appealing? </h3>
<p> My “Ideal Job” that was found on seek is the Head of IT at Monde Nissin Australia. The role consists of many responsibilities as it is the highest chain of command. This role oversees the company’s management, which involves managing all employee’s performance levels and relationships. The role also requires the control of cash flow and a performance report to be created occasionally. This position involves management and organisation which are 2 aspects that make this job appealing to me. I enjoy working in teams and I have the ability to discuss with all members of the team and help to delegate roles that would allow for the task to be completed before the deadline. While the management aspect of the job is appealing the role still incorporates IT operations such as Infrastructure, Security, Governance and Networks which still allows me to have some sort of connection to the roots of IT as it all isn’t just purely people managing. Being the Head of IT requires innovation and the ability to be proactive, this involves introducing new ways to be efficient and introducing new systems or software.

<h3> Required skills and qaulifications </h3>
<p> 
This job requires a degree in computer science or related field alongside a minimum of 3 year’s experience in a senior management role in the IT industry. This role requires a deep understanding around IT operations including systems, infrastructure, networks, security, vendor management and developments. Experience in leading IT teams is required as the role includes a large amount of people’s management. This role also requires a background in managing external IT vendors, helpdesks and service providers with outcomes that are efficient and effective. Finally, strong project management communication and interpersonal skills are required due to the large amount of employee responsibilities that role acquires.
</p>
<h3> My qaulifications and how I'll obtain more </h3>
<p>
The qualifications that I currently have is a Certificate III in Information, Digital Media and Technology which has given me the experience in working in groups and being as efficient as possible. Communication and interpersonal skills are skills that I believe I currently acquire due to my experience working in teams from team sports and school projects that involve collaboration. I believe I will gradually develop more of the required skills and qualifications required for this role while completing my studies at RMIT, with the constant group collaboration and development of peoples skills I will obtain the experience needed for this position. Working on many assignments at one time can help fine tune my time management skills which is a skill that can be utilised while being the Head of IT at Monde Nissin Australia.
